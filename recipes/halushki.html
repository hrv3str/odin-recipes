    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Along with vareniki and salo, galushki is a very popular Ukrainian dish. It is a dumpling made of dough then boiled in water, milk or broth. They are cooked mostly with flour, adding semolina, cottage cheese or grated apples.</p>

    <p>The galushki are easily cooked, and their recipes aren’t very varied. However, there are some variants that depend on a region; for example, the Southern Ukraine boasts galushki in tomato sauce.</p>
    <p></p>The galushki is a second course, and they are served with sour cream, sometimes with gravy.</p>
    <h2>Ingedients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>100 g of sour cream</li>
        <li>3 glasses of flour</li>
        <li>100 ml of water</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>100 g of dairy butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add the water in the flour; stir well.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the nearly melted dairy butter in flour with water. Stir till it is homogeneous.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Knead the dough. Don’t press too much on the dough because it might be too stiff. It should be soft and airy. Cover the dough with napkin and let it rest for 15-20 mins.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Roll the dough out; it should be 0.5-1 cm thick. Cut it into pieces of any form (usually squares).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Put the piece into salted boiling water and cook for 10 mins over a low heat. Pull out the galushki that are at the top. Place them in the colander or sieve to remove the water excess.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Heat the oil in the frying pan. Put the galushki there and fry them a little. Serve the galushki hot seasoned with sour cream.</li>
    </ol>
